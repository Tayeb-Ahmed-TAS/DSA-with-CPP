# Sorted Array Search (Staircase Search)

Write a function that searches for an element in row wise and column wise sorted 2D Array.

## Conditions

* The 2D array is sorted in row wise and column wise.
* The 2D array is square matrix.
* The 2D array is not empty.

## Input

```cpp
10 20 30 40
15 25 35 45
27 29 37 48
32 33 39 50
```

## Output

```cpp

Element 29 is found at (2, 1)
Element 37 is found at (2, 2)
Element 32 is found at (3, 1)

```

## Complexity

* Time Complexity: O(n + m)

  * n is the number of rows
  * m is the number of columns

* Space Complexity: O(1)
