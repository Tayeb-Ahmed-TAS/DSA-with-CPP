# 1.2.3. Bit Manipulation Problems

## 1.2.3.1 Replace Bits in N by M

### Problem Statement

You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions i and j.
Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M.
M (becomes a substring of N locationed at and starting at j).

### Input

```Input

N = 10000000000;

M = 10101;

i = 2, j = 6

Output : 1001010100

```

### Output

```Output

1001010100
