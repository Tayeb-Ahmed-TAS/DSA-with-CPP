# Divide & Conquer

## Introduction

Divide and conquer is a powerful algorithm that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem independently, and combines their solutions to solve the original problem. This approach is particularly effective for problems that can be recursively divided into smaller instances of the same problem.

It is widely used in various algorithms, including sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort, as well as in searching algorithms like Binary Search. The key idea is to divide the problem into smaller parts, solve each part, and then combine the results to get the final solution.

## Key Concepts

- **Divide**: Split the problem into smaller subproblems.

- **Conquer**: Solve each subproblem independently.

- **Combine**: Merge the solutions of the subproblems to form the solution to the original problem.
