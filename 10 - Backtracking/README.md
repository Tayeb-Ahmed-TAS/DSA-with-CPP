# Backtracking

Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally, building candidates for solutions and abandoning candidates ("backtracking") as soon as it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid solution.

## Problem Types

- **Decision Problems**: Check for feasible solutions.

- **Optimization Problems**: Find the best solution among all feasible solutions.

- **Enumeration Problems**: Find all feasible solutions.

## Common Backtracking Problems

- **N-Queens Problem**: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

- **Sudoku Solver**: Fill a partially filled 9x9 grid with digits so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9.

- **Subset Sum Problem**: Determine if there is a subset of a given set of integers that sums to a specific target.

- **Permutations and Combinations**: Generate all possible arrangements or selections of a set of items.
